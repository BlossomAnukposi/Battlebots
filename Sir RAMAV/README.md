## Sir Reginald: Activities
The second part of the relay race is the line maze. This part will be completed by Sir Reginald. The task is to program Sir Reginald in such a way that he will only start moving once Purpie places the relay object in front of him after which he needs to follow a black line maze to the finish line. After he gets to the destination, he must be able to drop the relay object in the second relay station for the last bot to pick it up.
